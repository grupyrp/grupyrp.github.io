  template environment.

  admin panel load.

2.1
---

Released on 12th of April 2016

- Fixed a code signing issue on OS X 10.10.3 and lower.

2.0
---

Released on 11th of April 2016

- Added `_discoverable` system field which controls if a page should show
  up in `children`.  The default is that a page is discoverable.  Setting it
  to `False` means in practical terms that someone needs to know the URL as
  all collection operations will not return it.
- Added `for_page` function to pagination that returns the pagiantion for a
  specific page.
- Make pagination next_page and prev_page be None on the edges.
- Allow plugins to provide publishers.
- Added `|markdown` filter.
- Added French translations.
- Unicode filenames as final build artifacts are now explicitly disallowed.
- Serve up a 404.html as an error page in the dev server.
- Improvements to the path normalization and alt handling.  This should support
  URL generation in more complex cases between alts now.
- Show a clearer error message when URL generation fails because a source
  object is virtual (does not have a path).
- Empty text is now still valid markdown.
- Lektor clean now loads the plugins as well.
- Basic support for type customization.
- Fields that are absent in a content file from an alternative are now pulled
  from the primary content file.
- Development server now resolves index.html for assets as well.
- Markdown processing now correctly adjusts links relative to where the
  rendered output is rendered.
- Added Dutch translations.
- Added Record.get_siblings()
- Added various utilties: build_url, join_path, parse_path
- Added support for virtual paths and made pagination work with it.
- Added support for Query.distinct
- Add support for pagination url resolving on root URL.
- Server information can now also contain extra key/value pairs that
  can be used by publishers to affect the processing.
- The thumbnails will now always have the correct width and height set
  as an attribute.
- added datetime type
- added support for the process_image utility functions so that plugins
  can use it directly.
- added support for included_assets and excluded_assets in the project file.
- added Spanish translations.
- added Japanese translations.
- added support for discovering existing alts of sources.
- added support for image cropping.
- added preliminary support for publishing on windows.
- children and attachments can now have a hidden flag configured explicitly.
  Attachments will also no longer inherit the hidden flag of the parent
  record as that is not a sensible default.
- changed internal sqlite consistency mode to improve performance on HDDs.
- allow SVG files to be treated as images.  This is something that does not
  work in all situations yet (in particular thumbnailing does not actually
  do anything for those)

1.2.1
-----

Released on 3rd of February 2016

- Bugfix release primarily for OS X which fixes a code signing issue.

1.2
---

Released on 1st of February 2016

- Fixed an error that caused unicode characters in the project
  name to be mishandled in the quickstart.
- Do not create empty folders when the quickstart skips over files.
- Empty values for the slug field now pull in the default.
- Corrected a bug in hashing in the FTP publisher that could cause
  files to not upload correctly.
- Improved error message for when imagemagick cannot be found.
- Fixed scrolling in the admin for firefox and some other browsers.
- Fixed a problem with deleting large projects due to sqlite limitations.
- Fixed admin preview of root page in firefox.
- Changed FTPS data channel to use TLS.

1.1
---

Released on 27th of December 2015

- Fixed a bug where resolving URL paths outside of alts did not
  fall back to asset resolving.
- verbose mode now correctly displays traceback of build failures.
- Fixed a bug that caused build failures not to be remembered.
- Fixed a bad EXIF attribute (longitude was misspelt)
- Use requests for URL fetching instead of urllib.  This should fix
  some SSL errors on some Python versions.
- Parent of page now correctly resolves to the right alt.
- Publish from a temporary folder on the same device which solves
  problems on machines with `/tmp` on a different drive.

---
